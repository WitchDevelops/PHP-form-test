# About
Goal of this project was to write backend code to handle HTML form submission. I used PHP Mailer library and wanted to use Google SMTP for this.

# Tech stach
* HTML
* classless CSS [(Water)](https://watercss.kognise.dev/)
* PHP

# Live

# Issue
I keep getting "405 access denied" error. Gmail seetings seem to be fine.

# Solution
For now, I decide to use formsubmit backend for form submission. The main benefit of this solution is that I can simply set my customer's email address as the endpoint and the whole process goes very smooth. The main drawback is using a third-party provider instead of my own solution.

# What I learned
I learned a bit of PHP and a bit about SMTP services.
I also learned how to set up PHP and a local Apache server on my own machine, and that GitHub Pages don't support PHP.
I learned that classless CSS exist and are extremely easy to use.
Here is a blog with a list of some classless CSS stylesheets: [blogpost](https://css-tricks.com/no-class-css-frameworks/)
